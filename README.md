# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Amazon_Customers_Sentiment_Analysis

I have done Data Analysis on Amazon Customer dataset.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Plotly](), [Pandas](), [Seaborn](), [Matplotlib](), [Textblob](), [WordCloud](), [NLTK]() etc for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook]() for coding!

# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

In this Project,

I will analyze the Amazon reviews. The reviews are unstructured. In other words, the text is unorganized. 

Sentiment analysis, however, helps us make sense of all this unstructured text by automatically tagging it. 

Sentiment analysis helps us to process huge amounts of data in an efficient and cost-effective way.

**In this Project, I have:**

* Give a brief theoretical background about sentiment analysis

* Perform sentiment analysis

* Provide python codes for each step.

**You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook for more!**
